# :camera: High Performance Soccer Player Tracking System with Convolutional Neural Networks
Visual object tracking has many practical applications in sports, such as tracking motion trajectory, recording playerâ€™s speed and helping make strategies. However, modern soccer has become a very fast-paced affair and with players who possess blistering pace and acceleration to volt forward. Considering that the video streams have a higher frame rate, achieving top tracking performance over real-time speed is considered as one of the main challenges. In this paper, we aim to implement a comprehensive soccer player tracking system which can run at frame-rates beyond real-time, and is easy to use in practice.

We equipped the tracker with a state-of-the-art Siamese region proposal network (Siamese-RPN), and trained the network end-to-end off-line with Youtube-BB dataset. In the inference phase, the tracking task can be defined as a local one-shot detection task for a seed up. In order to optimize the feature extractor network in the model, we tested and evaluated different backbones on the public dataset VOT2021. Experiments illustrate that ResNet-50 serving as a backbone in the Siamese-RPN tracking model actually outperforms the modified AlexNet on several aspects, including expected average overlap(EAO), accuracy and robustness. A comprehensive soccer player tracking system also need to manage interaction. As shown in Fig. 1, we used the Tkinter for front-end design, which is one of the most popular graphical user interface(GUI) libraries in Python. Finally, by providing a tracking demo, we can demonstrate that our soccer player tracker runs effectively at least 60 FPS frame rate in a soccer game video stream.
